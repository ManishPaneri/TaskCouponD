Akhil runs a company. He wants to give salary hike to employees in his company. He writes all
the employee names in a sheet of paper. The order of names on the sheet is fixed (their positions
are fixed), and each of them has a rating score according to his or her performance in the
company. Akhil wants to give at least 1 rupee hike to each employee. If two employees are
positioned next to each other, then the one with the higher rating must get more hike. Akhil also
wants to save money, so he needs to minimize the total number of amount given to the
employees.

company. Each of the following N lines contains an integer that indicates the rating of each
employee.

spend in total.
